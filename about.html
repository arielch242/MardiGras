                        The holiday of <strong>Mardi Gras </strong>is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including
                        the city
                        of New Orleans.
                        Celebrations
                        are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
                        Wednesday
                        (the
                        start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day
                        (weather
                        permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take
                        place
                        the
                        last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
                        Orleans
                        and
                        surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).</p>
                    <p>
                        The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                        parade
                        schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus,
                        the
                        earliest,
                        Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known
                        for
                        holding
                        large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
                        celebrities
                        as
                        grand
                        marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as
                        their
                        Kings),
                        as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float
                        riders
                        traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful
                        plastic
                        beads,
                        doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys, but throws can
                        also
                        include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route
                        each
                        year.</p>
                    <p>
                        While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans
                        and
                        Dauphin, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along
                        St.
                        Charles
                        Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally
                        concludes
                        with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

                        Mayor Joseph Fitzgerald O'Malley Fitzpatrick O'Donnell The Edge Quimby, nicknamed Diamond
                        Joe, is a recurring character from the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by
                        Dan Castellaneta, and first appeared in the episode "Bart Gets an F". Quimby is the mayor of
                        Springfield, and is a composite parody of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and certain other members of
                        the Kennedy family who have entered politics.
